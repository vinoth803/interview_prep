### Introduction
network is digital telecommunciations which enables the nodes to share the resources.
 **router** - provide connectivity between 2 lans over internet (isr 1000, isr 900, )
 **switch** - provide connectivity to host within the lan
 **server** - device that provides functions or services to a client
 **client** - device that access the service that made available by the server
**firewall** - monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules

### Network Devices
**hub** --  Layer1 -- 1 collision domain -- half duplex 
**bridge** -- Layer2 -- Segments Lans -- 2 Collision domain -- Fewer ports
**switch** -- Layer2 -- has mac table -- Full duplex -- multiple collision domain
**router** -- layer3 -- has ip table
-- full duplex -- fewer ports

TCP - connection oriented , reliable. good for trusted transcations 
Uses - ACK, SEQ number, CHECKSUM

Estiables connection
PC1 ----SYN-----> PC2
PC1 <--SYNC-ACK-- PC2
Pc1 ---ACK------> PC2

# IP Addrees
Unique identifier to identidy a network device in a network

### IPV4 vs IPV6
IPV4 -- 32 bits (192.168.10.1)
        needs subnet mask (255.255.255.0)
        whenever there is a '255'it is the network part of it.
        host part of the ip address.

# üåê IPv4 Address Classes

IP addresses are divided into five classes: **A, B, C, D, and E**, based on their leading bits and intended usage.

## üìä IPV4 Classes Overview

| Class | Range (First Octet) | Default Subnet Mask     | Number of Hosts per Network | Usage                          |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| A     | 1 ‚Äì 126              | 255.0.0.0                | ~16 million                  | Large networks (e.g., ISPs)    |
| B     | 128 ‚Äì 191            | 255.255.0.0              | ~65,000                      | Medium-sized networks          |
| C     | 192 ‚Äì 223            | 255.255.255.0            | 254                          | Small networks (e.g., LANs)    |
| D     | 224 ‚Äì 239            | N/A                      | N/A                          | Multicast groups               |
| E     | 240 ‚Äì 255            | N/A                      | N/A                          | Reserved for experimental use  |

> Note: 127.x.x.x is reserved for loopback (localhost), so it's not used for Class A networks.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Class A**: Supports a few networks with many hosts.
- **Class B**: Balances number of networks and hosts.
- **Class C**: Supports many networks with few hosts.
- **Class D**: Used for multicast (e.g., streaming).
- **Class E**: Reserved for future or experimental purposes.

## üîí Private IP Ranges

| Class | Private IP Range            |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| A     | 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255   |
| B     | 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255 |
| C     | 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255 |

These private IPs are used within internal networks and are **not routable on the public internet**.

192.168.130.0/24 means all the 3 octets are for network
192.168.130.0 (network address)
192.168.130.255 (broadcast address)
so the range of the host in this example is 256-2=254 hosts

## IPV6

it is 128 bits it is hextets. It is hexadecimal
it is 64bits - network 

2001:0dab:0000:0000:a111:b222:c333:d444
2001:0dab::a111:b222:c333:d444

"::" means all zeros inbetween


# üåê IPv6 Addressing Overview

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the successor to IPv4, designed to solve the problem of IP address exhaustion and improve routing efficiency, security, and scalability.

## üìä IPv6 vs IPv4

| Feature              | IPv4                          | IPv6                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Address Length       | 32 bits                       | 128 bits                             |
| Address Format       | Decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1)   | Hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:0db8::1)     |
| Total Addresses      | ~4.3 billion                  | ~340 undecillion (2¬π¬≤‚Å∏)              |
| Header Complexity    | Complex                       | Simplified                           |
| NAT Required         | Yes                           | No (end-to-end connectivity)         |
| Built-in Security    | Optional                      | Mandatory (IPSec)                    |
| Broadcast Support    | Yes                           | No (uses multicast instead)          |

## üß© IPv6 Address Structure

An IPv6 address is written as **eight groups of four hexadecimal digits**, separated by colons:

2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334


### üîß Compression Rules:
- Leading zeros in each group can be omitted.
- Consecutive groups of zeros can be replaced with `::` (only once per address).

Example compressed:

2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334


## üè∑Ô∏è IPv6 Address Types

| Type            | Prefix         | Purpose                                  |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Unicast         | Various        | One-to-one communication                 |
| Multicast       | ff00::/8       | One-to-many communication                |
| Anycast         | Shared         | One-to-nearest (based on routing)        |
| Link-local      | fe80::/10      | Local network segment communication      |
| Unique-local    | fc00::/7       | Private addressing (similar to IPv4 private ranges) |
| Global Unicast  | 2000::/3       | Publicly routable addresses              |

## üîí IPv6 Highlights

- **No need for NAT**: Every device can have a globally unique address.
- **Built-in IPSec**: Security is integrated from the ground up.
- **Efficient routing**: Aggregated prefixes simplify routing tables.
- **Auto-configuration**: Devices can configure themselves using SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto Configuration).

# üß† Media Access Control (MAC) ‚Äì Networking Essentials

Media Access Control (MAC) is a sublayer of the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** in the OSI model. It governs how devices access and transmit data over a shared communication medium, ensuring orderly and efficient communication.

---

## üì¶ MAC Sublayer Responsibilities

- **Addressing**: Assigns unique MAC addresses to devices for identification.
- **Frame Delimiting**: Encapsulates data into frames for transmission.
- **Channel Access**: Controls when devices can transmit to avoid collisions.
- **Error Detection**: Adds checksums (Frame Check Sequence) to detect errors.
- **Collision Handling**: Uses protocols to manage or avoid data collisions.

---

## üîó MAC Address Format

A **MAC address** is a 48-bit identifier, typically shown as:
00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

- **First 24 bits**: Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) ‚Äì identifies the manufacturer.
- **Last 24 bits**: Device-specific identifier ‚Äì unique to each network interface.

MAC addresses are **burned into hardware** but can be spoofed or changed in software.

---

## üì° MAC Protocols

| Protocol        | Used In         | Description |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **CSMA/CD**     | Ethernet (wired) | Listens before transmitting; detects collisions and retries |
| **CSMA/CA**     | Wi-Fi (wireless) | Avoids collisions by waiting and acknowledging |
| **Token Passing** | Token Ring, FDDI | Devices transmit only when holding a token |
| **Polling**     | Master-slave setups | Central controller decides who transmits |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è MAC vs LLC

The Data Link Layer is split into two sublayers:

| Sublayer | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **MAC**  | Controls access to the physical medium |
| **LLC**  | Provides interface to the Network Layer and handles error checking |

---

## üß≠ Why MAC Matters

- Enables **device-level communication** on local networks
- Prevents **data collisions** and ensures fair access
- Supports **efficient transmission** in both wired and wireless environments
- Forms the foundation for **network security** features like MAC filtering

---

## üîí MAC Filtering (Security Feature)

MAC filtering is a method used in routers and switches to allow or deny network access based on MAC addresses.

- **Whitelist**: Only approved MAC addresses can connect
- **Blacklist**: Specific MAC addresses are blocked

Note: MAC filtering is **not foolproof** ‚Äî MAC addresses can be spoofed.
